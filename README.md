A complete, **privacy-first** and fully local alternative to Life360 for Home Assistant. This suite provides advanced location tracking with rich notifications and ensures your devices stay powered up.

## 1. 🌍 Person & Zone Tracker (Core)
The heart of the system. An advanced automation blueprint designed to track arrivals and departures with precision, style, and reliability.

**Key Features:**
* 📸 **Dynamic Notifications:** Displays the user's profile picture (with smart fallback to a brand logo).
* 📍 **Clickable Maps:** Open the location map directly from the notification action.
* ⏱️ **Duration Logging:** Tracks time spent at a location (e.g., "Left Work after 8h 30m").
* 🛡️ **Defensive Logic:** Handles GPS drift ("flapping") and gracefully ignores unavailable/unknown states.
* 🤫 **Privacy & Quiet Mode:** Configurable quiet hours to mute notifications at night.

## 2. 🔋 Battery Monitor (Smart Add-on)
Reliable tracking requires power. This "Smart Alert" blueprint monitors your devices and warns you before they go dark.

**Key Features:**
* 🧠 **Anti-Spam Logic:** Intelligently alerts only **once** per discharge cycle (prevents constant nagging).
* 📱 **Unified Branding:** Uses the same visual identity and logo as the Tracker.
* ⚙️ **QA-Verified:** Optimized `parallel` execution to handle multiple devices reporting simultaneously without errors.

### ⚙️ Configuration Guide
When you copy the [dashboard YAML code](dashboards/person_tracker_view.yaml), you must replace the following placeholders with your specific entities:

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `person.your_name` | The main person entity you want to track on the map. | `person.philip` |
| `sensor.your_device_battery_level` | The battery sensor of the tracked device. | `sensor.pixel_9_battery_level` |
| `sensor.your_device_geocoded_location` | Sensor providing the address text (from Companion App or integration). | `sensor.pixel_9_geocoded_location` |
| `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | **Required.** Your personal API Key from Google Cloud Platform. | `AIzaSyD...` |

**Requirements (HACS):**
* [Google Maps Card](https://github.com/kreativ-monkey/hass-google-map-card) (Required for history map)
* [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) (Required for text styling)

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Install Companion App:** Ensure the Home Assistant Companion App is installed on your devices for location reporting.
2. **Import Blueprints:** Click the badges above to import the automations directly into Home Assistant.
3. **Create Automations:** Set up your person/zone tracker and battery monitor using the imported blueprints.
4. **(Optional) Dashboard:** Copy the dashboard YAML code to a new view in your Lovelace dashboard.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Issue: History or Logbook is empty/inconsistent.**
If your person entity updates are missing from the logbook, it is often due to phone battery optimizations killing the Home Assistant app in the background.

**Fix for Android (Pixel/Samsung):**
1. Go to **Settings** -> **Apps** -> **Home Assistant**.
2. Tap **Battery**.
3. Change setting to **Unrestricted** (or "Don't optimize").
4. Ensure **Location** permission is set to **"Allow all the time"**.
